# Algo-Practice

This is my collection of JavaScript algorythm practices!

Each month has it's own folder along with each day. The files them selves are named after the name of the problem. 

I'll keep track of where I am getting these problems from incase you want to compare solutions.

If you see a better or more efficent way to achieve a result please feel free to let me know!
